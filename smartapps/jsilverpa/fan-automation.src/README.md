# Fan Automation

## Synopsis
This SmartApp is for use with SmartThings.   It turns on a fan when the outside temperature is X degrees cooler than the inside temperature.

## Features
* Ability to control the offset so that the fan will only run if the outside temperature is X (user-configurable) degrees cooler than the inside temperature.
* Optional motion controller to only run the fan if there is motion detected.
* Optional ability for manual fan-on/fan-off to override any automated settings for a user-configurable amount of time.

## Credits
This SmartApp was inspired from Scottin Pollock's "Close/Open the Windows" SmartApp.
